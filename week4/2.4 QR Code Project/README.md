# WEEK 4
## PROJECT NOTES

QR CODE PROJECT
- TO START: RUN index.js and follow instruction 
- Prompts user to enter a URL using the inquirer npm package
- Generates a QR code image using the qr-image npm package
- Saves the user-entered URL to a text file using the fs module
- Added input validation to ensure the URL is not empty and properly formatted
- Builds on the QR code example by improving user interaction, validation, and documentation

NOTES From ADMIN
- Made the code more friendly to understand what happening, struggled with figuring where to start
- Worked a lot on the index.js to give clear instructions to the best of my ability and make it so anyone can just dive in
- More clear feedback on whether it succeeded
- Realized those packages can have a lot of files no joke
