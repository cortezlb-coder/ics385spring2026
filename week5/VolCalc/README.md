# WEEK 5 
## PROJECTS NOTES

/VolCalc
- I struggled a lot on this too but WSSchools helped a lot
- I consolidated /f2c into this file so it contains both
- codespace was difficult to learn at first, prefer VS
- learned that positioning the GET POST is important, wasn't able to get /f2c show but figured it out
