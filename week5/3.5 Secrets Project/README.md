# WEEK 5 
## PROJECTS NOTES

/Secret project
- learned a lot about the BTS of a simple log in screen and how much a programmer has to consider in terms of security
- never has passwords exposed in plaintext
- played around a bunch to see if I can secure the log in page to prevent brute force attacks
- I am also considered how to prevent denial of service attacks since I assume having so much sessions requesting can cause a huge strain on a server
